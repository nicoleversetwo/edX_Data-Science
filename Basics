###Basic
​
# 'age' object is a numeric object and 'favorite dish'
# object is a character object
# the operator '<-' associates the variable age with the number 25
age <- 25
​
# the operator '<-' associates the variable favorite.dish with 
# the number "almonds"
favorite.dish <- "pizza"
​
# 'age' can concatenate more than only one age as 
# well as favorite dish
# the function c(object01, object02, ...) 
# concatenates objects
age <- c(25, 30, 26)
favorite.dish <- c("pizza", "cake", "steak")
​
# age and favorite dish is a vector.
age
# each component could be accessed using '[position]'.
age[1]
age[2]
​
# favorite dish is also a vector.
favorite.dish
# each component could be accessed using '[position]'.
favorite.dish[1]
favorite.dish[2]
​
# sex is also a vector which could assume 
# only two possible values: "female" and "male".
sex <- c("female", "male", "female")
sex
​
# sex has the special class called factor which
# will be defined using the function
# factor(object, levels)
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male"))
sex
​
# A data.frame can be defined based on vectors
# using the function data.frame(object01, object02, )
student <- c("s01", "s02", "s03")
​
bioinformatics.course <- 
  data.frame(student, sex, age, favorite.dish)
​
# To access the data frame biostatistics.course
# you have just to type the name
bioinformatics.course
​
# variables from a data frame can be accessed
# using the operator $ and the variable name
bioinformatics.course$student
​
bioinformatics.course$sex
